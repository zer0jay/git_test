# git_test

My first (kinda) GitHub repo!
Hello Odin!

May update the hello_world.txt with more hello worlds as I continue learning! Or maybe not!
Maybe (probably) I'll get distracted by all of the really cool projects I'll be building.
I'm also currently attending Western Governors University for a degree in Software Engineering so I'm hoping this can be a really good supplemental resource!
